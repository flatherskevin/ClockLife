This is a playground for clock building.

Primary goals:
1) Utilize AngularJS
2) Utilize JSON
3) Test different types of graphics implementations

There is no real directive with this build other than to learn more about AngularJS and JSON.
It is an easy environment to place around with different clock styles and work with intervals and timing of graphics.
